		<p> I am a research associate in the <a href="https://www.lcs2.in/"> LCS2 Lab </a> at IIT-Delhi, India advised by Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty.
		I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Syracuse University in 2017 and 
		started working in A10 Networks (develops load balancers) building modules for the control plane of ACOS operating system.
		Being interested ML and network security I moved to the Threat Intel team that uses Machine Learning models to mitigate DDoS attacks. We worked on

<!--  		I also had a brief stint at Latent Logic (acquired by <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>), a self-driving car startup in Oxford -->
		<p> My research work mainly revolves around deep reinforcement learning (RL), often with the goal of making RL methods suitable for real-world problems, and includes
		    an <a href="https://agarwl.github.io/rliable/">outstanding paper award</a> at NeurIPS.
